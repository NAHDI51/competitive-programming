# COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING

I have done competitive programming with much seriousness once. Now, while it stays with me as
one of the best periods I could ever remember, I the cognitive boosts and problem solving abilities
I acquired through competitive programming still remains constant with me. I owe a damn lot to 
competitive proramming for accelerating my logical thinking and interest on the broader context
of CS as a whole. Thus, imparting all the solutions to everyone is just the least bit I could ever do.

* Codes are mostly messy and uncommented. This is because most of the problems in 
competitive programming is systwritten with no sustainability and maintainability in mind. 
* All the codes are written in C++. This is the ideal language to use for competitive programming,
along with Java. 
* I have done problem solving on numerous websites. I will add them correspondingly. 

## Leetcode 

Only the **necessary portion** (e.g the function, and the dependencies of the *solve function*)
is given. Thus, for debugging purposes, please write your own driver function, as well as 
other necessary stuff.
